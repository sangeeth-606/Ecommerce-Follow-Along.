## Why This Project
I chose this project because it provides an opportunity to practice and demonstrate a wide range of development skills, including frontend and backend development, database schema design, and secure authentication. Building an e-commerce platform is both challenging and rewarding, as it allows me to explore real-world scenarios and enhance my ability to create scalable web applications.

##  Milestone 2:
Implemented a user login page with username and password fields. Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design. Validates input and handles user authentication upon form submission.


## Milestone 3: Server Setup
Set up the server with express for HTTP requests and mongoose for MongoDB. Configured routing and database connections, providing endpoints for user authentication and other functionalities.
